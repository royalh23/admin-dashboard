This project is mainly a demonstration of my CSS Grid skills. I have used
Grid extensively for laying out items on the page and Flexbox too whenever 
necessary. 

- For the main content, auto-fit property from Grid has been utilized to provide
a responsive layout for the cards. 
- SVGs have also been used for scalable and smooth icons.
